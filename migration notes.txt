Aws migration

======================================================
worked on cloud migration 

we have customer on-prem datacenters in delf city  in europe

there are few servers migrated to aws and azure

i worked on server migration and storage and db migrations

in server migration 

used the tools like cloud endure and server migration service 

in database migration

database migration service


in storage migration 

worked on netapp cloudsync and aws storage gateway and datasync like 

nfs-s3 and azureblob to nfs 



interms of azure worked on azure migrate 

and site-recovery service to plan for setting up DR


Migration process:
=======================

we have migration phases:

inventory
assesment
planning
migraion
test
validation
recovery- 

assesments like full vm or physical server details 

what is the hardware and cpu, memory network and disk capacity what type of application services running 

so once we collect the inventory 


we will perform assesment using discovery tools like in aws app discovery and risk network also some servers

we performed using manual assesments.

there after 

we will discuss on the cost like before we plan to migration to the cloud datacenters- 

here capacity planning will do it like

what is the estimation cost and services recommmnendations and pricing model either we use same license or 

subcriptions..

so once client decided will plan to install the migrations agents server and configured to replicate the data.

based on the application criteria will decide the 

lift-shift migration 

in lift-shift migration actually we will copy the data first and ensure the replatforming the services readyness 

then will move the applications to the cloud datacenter to prefered regions..

here right we can use terraform to create the resource what would like to configure...


or 

live migration 

cloud endure

Database migration:
==========================


syncrnous: at a time data changes will replicate into two or more sources

asynhronous: at time data once updated on the source the changes will updated to target database

read replica in rds is one of the exmaple to enable the asyncrhonous replication.....

we have to install database migration replication instance in the aws like dmsm4.large dmst3.large

based on the workload requirements

once we installed the dms in cloud we will have to ensure the vpn connectivity like from on-prem to aws

once site-to site vpn is configured we will create tasks

source target and destination target

source target can be sql ec2 - rds or either any of the database nodes

for continous replication if we want then will ensure database indexing and CDC change data capture from 

source database to target tabase on the required effected changes...

it is one time configration 

but taks we have update what data can be replciate




in dms the common issues we have faced on the indexing bad Queries optimization and some times cdc observed 

the latency we used to check with aws and db team to fix the problem...

also 

schema conversion tool will configured to check the schema of source database and destination database.

to validate like table schma and parameters 

RDS

worked on SQL server and postgesql 

parmeter group: to configure engine settings like null values other important engine settings.

subnet group: collections of private subnets to configure the datbase

option group : for example if we want to backup the database and enable the catalogs those are the options 

we can configure to rds engine

=============================================================================================================

Storage migration:

only 

nfs.. 

s3..



netapp cloud sync we used to copy the data from on-prem to aws 

migration of the backups to cloud

like backup files will create task to synchronize the data

datasync should be configured in on-prem..






RTO: recovery time objective

RPO: recovery point objective

SLA: service level aggrement
'
SLO: service level own

how do you get the changes

we are using service now tickeing tool to crete the below prioties changes to plan migration workloads

like

P1: 2 hrs critical

P2: high  4 hrs

P3: medium 24 hrs

P4:  3 days 


rds..

windows ad need to integration right..

like domain based authentic


yes..

cluster configuration

dense compute 


maximum 10 nodes..

redshift 



rds is managed service

and will create instnace and configure storage monitoring backups and maintanace windws

also will ensure security manger


compute node..


git pull push

commit 

logs

fetch 

and merge...

clone 

sshh, https...


index.




s3sync..

yes

like fi
